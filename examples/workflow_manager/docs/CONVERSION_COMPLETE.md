# ✅ Successfully Converted to Justfile + UV Setup!

The Workflow Manager application has been **successfully converted** from Makefile to **Justfile** with **UV package manager** for modern Python development.

## 🚀 **What Changed**

### **✅ Replaced Makefile with Justfile**
- **Modern Command Runner**: Switched from `make` to `just` for better syntax and functionality
- **Enhanced Commands**: Added more comprehensive development commands
- **Better Documentation**: Clear command descriptions and usage

### **✅ Integrated UV Package Manager**
- **Fast Installation**: UV is 10-100x faster than pip for package management
- **Modern Python Tooling**: Better dependency resolution and virtual environment management
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for both development and production environments

### **✅ Modern Project Configuration**
- **pyproject.toml**: Modern Python package configuration standard
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Kept setup.py for backwards compatibility
- **Better Tooling**: Configured Black, isort, mypy, pytest in pyproject.toml
